# Design Guidelines: Accommodation Collection

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based**: Inspired by luxury travel platforms (Airbnb, Booking.com) with elevated safari/nature aesthetics. Focus on immersive imagery, generous whitespace, and sophisticated typography that conveys exclusivity and adventure.

## Color & Visual Treatment

**Primary Palette**:
- Primary Teal: 167 84% 32% (main brand actions, key CTAs)
- Accent Teal: 167 84% 45% (hover states, highlights)
- Warm Beige: 35 40% 94% (backgrounds, cards)
- Deep Beige: 35 25% 88% (subtle borders, dividers)
- Rich Brown: 25 30% 25% (text, headings)
- Soft Cream: 40 50% 98% (alternate backgrounds)

**Visual Strategy**: Earth-toned foundation with teal as strategic accent. High-contrast photography against neutral backgrounds. Minimal use of gradientsâ€”rely on natural imagery for visual richness.

## Typography System

**Headings (Playfair Display - Serif)**:
- Hero Display: text-6xl/text-7xl lg:text-8xl, font-bold, tracking-tight

- Content sections: max-w-6xl mx-auto
