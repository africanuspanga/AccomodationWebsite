### **Prompt for Next.js Agent: Accommodation Collection - Full Web Application Build**

**To the Agent:**

I am commissioning you to build a complete, professional, and scalable travel web application for a new tourism brand, **Accommodation Collection**. You are a highly skilled and experienced frontend developer, and I expect you to deliver a top-tier, production-ready product.

**The Brand and Project Goal:**

* **Brand Identity:** **Accommodation Collection** is a premium tourism brand specializing in curating tours, accommodations, and other travel services. Our mission is to provide unforgettable, safe, and family-friendly trips, backed by over 10 years of experience in the industry.
* **Design Inspiration:** The entire website design, from layout and user flow to overall aesthetic, should be a direct adaptation of the "Take Me To Tanzania" website, based on the screenshots provided. The visual style should be elegant, clean, and inspiring.
* **Brand Colors:** Please select a color palette that complements a premium travel brand. Use a primary color, a secondary accent color, and a neutral palette. A rich, earthy green or deep blue could work well as a primary color, paired with a warm accent like gold or orange, and a clean white/off-white for backgrounds. You have creative freedom here, but ensure the palette feels luxurious and inviting.
* **Content:** For now, all image containers must be left empty. This is a strict requirement as our team will upload the final images later. You must, however, use Google Search to find and populate all text-based content (names of hotels, national parks, tour descriptions, etc.) to make the pages look complete and realistic.
* **Backend-Readiness:** The entire application must be built with a forward-looking architecture. All dynamic content should be stored in a mock JSON file within the project. The code for fetching and displaying this data should be written in a way that it can be easily swapped out for a real API endpoint in the future. This includes defining clear data structures for all content types (e.g., Accommodations, Destinations, Itineraries).
