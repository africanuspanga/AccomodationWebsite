Over the fixed two-week period, volunteers live closely with the Maasai, gaining an understanding of their culture, customs, traditional crafts, and way of life. Activities may involve participating in daily tasks such as cattle herding, traditional cooking, beadwork, and learning about medicinal plants.

Your role involves providing essential daily care, offering companionship, and assisting staff with therapy or rehabilitative activities. This work is highly rewarding but can be emotionally demanding, requiring patience, compassion, and maturity, hence the 18+ age requirement.
